Project Overview
This project involves analyzing and visualizing sales data downloaded from Kaggle. The primary goal is to gain valuable insights that can help improve future sales. We will explore various correlations and visualizations to understand customer behavior, sales patterns, and other key metrics.

Key Objectives
Data Cleaning and Preparation

Remove any missing or duplicate values.
Standardize data formats for consistency.
Descriptive Statistics

Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.) for numerical columns.
Understand the distribution of categorical variables.
Correlation Analysis

Identify relationships between key variables such as:
Purchase Amount (USD) and Frequency of Purchases
Discount Applied and Purchase Amount (USD)
Promo Code Used and Purchase Amount (USD)
Review Rating and Purchase Amount (USD)
Use correlation coefficients to quantify the strength and direction of relationships.
Data Visualization

Bar Charts: Visualize the distribution of categorical variables (e.g., Item Purchased, Category, Gender).
Histograms: Understand the distribution of numerical variables (e.g., Purchase Amount, Review Rating).
Scatter Plots: Examine the relationship between two numerical variables (e.g., Purchase Amount and Frequency of Purchases).
Box Plots: Identify outliers and understand the spread of numerical data across different categories.
Heatmaps: Visualize correlations between multiple numerical variables.
Pie Charts: Show the proportion of different categories (e.g., Payment Method, Shipping Type).
Grouping and Aggregation

Group data by key attributes (e.g., Location, Subscription Status, Discount Applied) to find trends and patterns.
Calculate aggregate metrics (e.g., total sales, average purchase amount) for different groups.
Insights and Recommendations

Identify top-performing products and categories.
Understand customer demographics and preferences.
Provide actionable recommendations to improve sales strategies and customer engagement.
